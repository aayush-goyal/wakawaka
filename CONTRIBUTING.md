## 💻 Setup
You are free to use any IDE, but I recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Clone the repository on your machine. Run the setup commands:
```zsh
yarn install
```

This will install all the required dependencies. To spin up the app on your local server, run the `dev` command:
```zsh
yarn run dev
```

This will start the app on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

And voila, you are ready to play with the app. 🎉

## 🍒 Picking Issues
You can pick any unassigned issue from the Issue board. Create a new `feature/bugfix` branch against the issue and maintain all the changes in a single branch. Once done with the changes, raise a PR against the master branch for getting your changes merged.

I am also soon planning to open a public document containing the roadmap of the future features.

## 🌴 branches
Here are the description for branches:<br />
**[master]** - Changes are live in production for users. This branch is protected by branch rules.<br />
**[feature/*]** - New feature branch containing code for a single functionality.<br />
**[bugfix/*]** - New bugfix branch containing code for a single fix.

# 📜 General Guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive in your communication.
- Restrain from using abusive language.
- Be mindful of your time and effort. If you have taken a feature/issue and need some help, please let us know.
- Don't treat people basis their caste, sex, gender, race, religion, nationality, color, and etc. I treat everyone equally.
